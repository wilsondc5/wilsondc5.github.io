## First Blog Post

Hello everyone, and welcome to my blog! This is the first blog post for our assignment in the course, so my apologies if it is a bit rough.

This post is going to be talking about my best computing experiences so far in life.

### In-Class

Last semester (Fall 2021), I had the opportunity to take CS-5535 (Front-End Web Development). In this course, I was able to learn how to leverage Vue.js to create good-looking websites with relative ease. I personally really enjoyed this topic and have been able to use this knowledge for my senior thesis as well. The goal of my thesis is to create a lost & found application for the University that will assist students, faculty, and staff alike find their lost items around campus. Working on this application is what I would say is my best in-class experience so far.

(P.S. If you're reading this, I have a survey that is collecting data on the interest of such an application currently and am trying to get as many Appalachian community members to take it as possible. If you haven't taken it already, [please click here](https://forms.gle/Lou6TkgRfB3fL4wk8) and do so (it only takes a few minutes, I promise). Also, if you have any further questions/comments/concerns about my thesis topic, please leave a comment below or email me! I'd be more than happy to answer.)

### Outside Class

Since I work for the ITS department on campus, I have had quite a few computing opportunities outside of my classes. What I would consider my best experience would be helping create a new provisioning process for all of the University-owned Macs. For those not familiar, provisioning is the process of taking a computer out of the box and setting it up for use (in this case, it's used specifically on campus). This project required me to learn about MDMs (Mobile Device Management), ADE (Automated Device Enrollment), and many other concepts that are important to managing machines at a University. I also became the lead of working on the onboarding helper tool we used, [Octory](https://www.octory.io/), and created many visuals that every consultant on campus will now see when they set a computer up.
