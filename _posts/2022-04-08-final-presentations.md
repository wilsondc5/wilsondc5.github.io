# Final Presentations

As everyone started to give their initial ideas for their final presentations, I quickly realized how different most of the presentations were going to be. The one that stood out to me the most though is Jenna's, as exploring how technology is impacting the medical field. I feel like the research has a lot of real world applications, and I look forward to hearing what Jenna has to say about it!
