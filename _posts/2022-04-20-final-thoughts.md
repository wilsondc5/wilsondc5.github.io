# Final CS-4100 Post

1. What I'd put as the most important thing I learned more about this semester is time management. Not procrastinating and actually doing my schoolwork in advance helped a ton with my larger assignments.

2. I got to learn more about the legal side of app distribution. Our talks in class about patents, EULAs, and other documents opened my eyes to what has to be considered to distrbute an app ethically.

3. Another thing I found interesting this semester was learning more about privacy concerns on the internet. The documentary about Citizen Four really opened my eyes to the holes that remain in the current systems, and how there are ways for us to stop them from growing.

Ultimately, I've enjoyed the class thoroughly. I'd recommend that anyone taking the course not worry about presenting too much, since it's never as bad as it seems it'll be. If you go into it relaxed and know what you're talking about, everyone will be engaged and listen to what you have to say.
