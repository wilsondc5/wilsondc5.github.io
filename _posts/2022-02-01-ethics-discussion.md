## Ethics Discussion Reflection

When we were doing our ethics presentations in class, I was very nervous about what I was going to need to talk about. Since it was the first oral presentation in the course, I was worried about how it was going to be graded, how everyone else was going to view me, and a whole list of other things. I decided not to be one of the first to go, since I wanted to gain some idea of what everyone else was talking about. I was pleasantly surprised when everyone that went before me talked about similar ethics to what I had, and made me feel like we were all in the same boat.

When we later discussed what we thought about ethics, we all identified roughly the same things about what we said. A lot of us touched on how we were raised being what influenced our current ethics, but also how the internet had a role in shaping who we are now too. I do find it interesting how all of us from the same generation had this common thing influencing our growth, but I suppose that every generation has something like that, whether it be the internet or otherwise.

Overall this discussion was easier to have than I thought it was going to be and made it a little bit easier for me to participate in discussions in the class. I feel like I can more confidently add what I'm thinking to the discussion now that I have a better grasp on who all is in the class and what everyone else is thinking.
